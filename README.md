# javascript
I'm currently focused on JavaScript as I build my foundation in web development. Passionate about clean code, interactive UIs, and continuous learning.
I'm a self-motivated developer who recently took a deep dive into the world of JavaScript. What started as curiosity has turned into a real passion for building dynamic, interactive websites and applications. I've been learning JavaScript through hands-on practice—building small projects, debugging code, and gradually understanding how the web works behind the scenes.

I'm especially interested in front-end development, user experience, and writing code that not only works but is clean and maintainable. As I continue learning, I'm exploring tools and frameworks like React, Node.js, and Express to expand my skill set and create full-stack applications.

This GitHub profile is a space where I share my projects, experiments, and progress. Whether it's a small to-do app or a more complex web interface, each project represents a step forward in my development journey. I'm always open to collaboration, feedback, and learning from the community.

Thanks for visiting my profile—feel free to check out my repositories or connect with me!
